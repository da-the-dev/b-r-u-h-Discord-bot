#### What is this thing?

Simple question, really. It's one of my many bots for Discord bots that I created for fun/educational purpose. So, I don't think that would [~~use this link~~](google.com) to add the bot to your server (you need to have admin rights on the server).

#### What can it do?

I does some things. Here are some commands:

-   `!test` will reply a message if the bot is online
-   `!ping` will reply a message with the ping of the bot
-   `!help` will reply a message in DM with all of the commands
-   `!mkgrp {name} {@users[]}` will create a grop of 1 voice and text channels with names `{name}` and give rights to see and iteract with these channels to the author of the message and people he/she mentioned in `{@users[]}` <br>
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > !mkgrp coolgang @bro @bruh @supercooldaniel
    > ```
-   `!delete` will delete the created group.

#### Does it work 24/7?

Yes, I'm hosting the bot on Heroku 24/7

#### Can I use this bot?

Not yet. You can add it for later, but right now I wouldn't. I'm working on it, and hopefully one day b r u h Discord bot would be popular. You still can freely use any code I wrote.

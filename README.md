#### What is this thing?

Simple question, really. It's one of my many bots for Discord that I created for fun/educational purposes. It can analyze different commands entered by users on a Discord server. Down below you will see them and how to use them. It is the first project I take seriously and I plan to work hard on it. <br>
The current goal of this bot is for me to learn to code, share my code with the Internet and hopefully turn this project into something great.

#### What can it do?

It does some things. These are some of the commands I've implemented:

-   `!test` will reply a message if the bot is online.
-   `!ping` will reply a message with the ping of the bot.
-   `!help` will reply a message in DM with all of the commands.
-   `!mkgrp {name} {@users[]}` will create a grop of a voice and a text channel with names `{name}` and give rights to see and iteract with these channels to the author of the message and the people mentioned in `{@users[]}`. <br>
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > !mkgrp coolgang @bro @bruh @supercooldaniel
    > ```
    >
    > This will create a voice channel 'coolgang' and a text channel 'coolgang' and allow only you, user @bro, user @bruh and user @supercooldaniel to use them.
-   `!delete` will delete the created group.

#### OK, the commands are nice, how do I use them?

Just enter the command in chat.

#### Does it work 24/7?

Yes, I'm hosting the bot on Heroku 24/7

#### Can I use this bot?

Not yet. I removed the link for the sake of avoiding confusion. Since I want to add language support, I will have to create a settings menu and store the configurations for each server. This is a big task I'll need to work on I'm working on the bot, and hopefully, one day b r u h Discord bot would be popular.

#### Can I use your code?

You can freely use any code.

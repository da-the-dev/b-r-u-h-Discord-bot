## b r u h Disord bot

> #### QUICK WARNING
> THIS BOT REPLIES IN RUSSIAN. ENGLISH SUPPORT WILL ARRIVE IN APPROXIMATELY A MONTH

#### What is this thing?
Simple question, really. It's one of my many bots for Discord bots that I created for fun/educational purpose. So, I don't think that would [use this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=681127932957425711&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add the bot to your server (you need to have admin rights on the server).

#### What can it do?
I does some things. Here are some commands:
- `!test` will reply a message if the bot is online
- `!ping` will reply a message with the ping of the bot
- `!help` will reply a message in DM with all of the commands
- **[WORK IN PROGGRESS, DO NOT USE]** <br>
  `!mkgrp {name} {@users[]}` will create a grop of 1 voice and text channels with names `{name}` and give rights to see and iteract with these channels to the author of the message and people he/she mentioned in `{@users[]}` <br>
>Example:
> ```
>!mkgrp coolgang @bro @bruh @supercooldaniel
>```

#### Does it work 24/7?
Yes, I'm hosting the bot on Heroku 24/7

#### Can I use this bot?
Not yet. You can add it for later, but right now I wouldn't. I'm working on it, and hopefully one day b r u h Discord bot would be popular.
